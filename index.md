Hey, I'm Foong. During my undergraduate years at University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, I aspire to [promote student diversity in STEM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtJj1jAKOas) on campus, through my roles as Vice President of [Women and Gender Minorities in STEM](https://sites.google.com/view/uwecwistem/) (18-19) and Web Administrator of [Women in Information Technology Systems](https://www.facebook.com/UWECOMTECH/) (17-19). 

In my spare time, I enjoy [blogging](https://medium.com/@foongminwong), mentoring students/contributing to [AnitaB.org Open Source](https://github.com/anitab-org), learning new technologies, working on [random projects](https://github.com/foongminwong), doing pilates, cooking, etc.
