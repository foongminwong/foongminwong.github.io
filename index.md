Hello! I'm a senior at University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire studying Computer Science, Mathematics and Economics. 

I aspire to promote student diversity on campus, through my roles as Vice President of [Women and Gender Minorities in STEM](https://sites.google.com/view/uwecwistem/)(18-19) and Web Administrator of [Women in Information Technology Systems](https://www.facebook.com/UWECWITS/)(17-19).
