Hello! I'm a senior at University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire studying Computer Science, Mathematics and Economics. 

I aspire to [promote student diversity in STEM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtJj1jAKOas) on campus, through my roles as Vice President of [Women and Gender Minorities in STEM](https://sites.google.com/view/uwecwistem/) (18-19) and Web Administrator of [Women in Information Technology Systems](https://www.facebook.com/UWECWITS/) (17-19).

In my spare time, I enjoy [blogging](https://foongminwong.blogspot.com), volunteering, travelling, cooking, watching movies, and etc.
