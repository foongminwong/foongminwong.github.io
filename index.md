Hello! I'm a senior at University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire studying Computer Science, Mathematics and Economics. 👩🏻‍🎓

I aspire to promote student diversity on campus, through my roles as Vice President of [Women and Gender Minorities in STEM](https://sites.google.com/view/uwecwistem/) (18-19) ❤ and Web Administrator of [Women in Information Technology Systems](https://www.facebook.com/UWECWITS/) (17-19) 👩🏻‍💻.


In my spare time, I enjoy [blogging](https://foongminwong.blogspot.com), cooking🍳, watching movies🎞, and etc.
