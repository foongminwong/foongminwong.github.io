#### Faculty Mentor: [Dr. Danielle Brake](https://danielleamethyst.org/)
##### *Sep 2017 - May 2018*
#### Technologies Used: [Bertini_real](https://github.com/ofloveandhate/bertini_real), 3D Builder, Blender, Simplify3D, Ultibots D300VS, LulzBot TAZ (3D printers), PLA filament

* Learned how to use an open-source numerical software, Bertini_real to compute and decompose algebraic surfaces from [Herwig Hauser Gallery](https://homepage.univie.ac.at/herwig.hauser/gallery.html)
* Solidified algebraic surfaces with singularities via Blender
* Added support, configured printing process & 3D printed mathematical models such as [Kreuz](https://danielleamethyst.org/gallery/kreuz/), [Tobel](https://danielleamethyst.org/work_blog/tobel/), Stern, Croissant, and etc through Simplify3D
* Presented a [talk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ALCojQlIR8WPhhrVxmALFITjlwpCqHEK/view) at the Society of Industrial and Mathematics Annual Meeting 2018 (SIAM AN18) in Portland, Oregon.
